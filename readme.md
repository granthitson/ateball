# Ateball Bot [WIP]

Electron.js app with a Python backend to automate the playing of [eight ball pool](https://8ballpool.com/en/game). It uses OpenCV image processing to calculate and execute optimal moves.


This project started years ago with this [previous iteration](https://github.com/granthitson/AteBallPool). It was never intended (and still is) to be used to exploit or abuse gameplay in a competitive setting, or in a setting with real stakes. 

The goal of this project has always been purely educational; to improve my programming and to learn more about computer vision/image processing/etc. 

## Do I have permission to use this?

No, I have not added a license for a reason. Read more about what that means [here](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).

I also realize that some may not care about my permission, and as such **Ateball does not work out of the box**.
